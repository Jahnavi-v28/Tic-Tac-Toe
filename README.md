# Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax Algorithm

A Python implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe featuring an unbeatable AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. 

Features
- AI : Uses Minimax with alpha-beta pruning for optimal moves
- Clean terminal interface: Simple board visualization
- Error handling: Validates user input for correct moves
- Win/draw detection: Immediately recognizes game endings

 How It Works
1. Human player (`X`) vs Computer (`O`)
2. Players alternate turns on a 3Ã—3 grid
3. First to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
4. AI evaluates all possible moves using recursive Minimax scoring
